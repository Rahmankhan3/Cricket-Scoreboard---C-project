The Cricket Match Simulator is a C-based project that simulates a limited-overs cricket match between two teams. It provides a ball-by-ball simulation of the game, tracking player performances, team scores, and match outcomes. This project demonstrates the use of C programming to model real-world scenarios and interactive gameplay.

Features:
Dynamic Player Management: Tracks the stats of 11 players from each team, including runs scored, balls faced, and wickets taken.
Ball-by-Ball Input: Allows users to input scores or events (e.g., runs, extras, wickets) for every ball.
Realistic Game Mechanics: Handles striker rotation, bowler selection, and prevents the same bowler from bowling consecutive overs.
Comprehensive Scorecard: Displays individual and team scores after each inning and declares the match result.
Interactive Gameplay: Lets users choose the toss winner, make decisions (batting/bowling first), and simulate every aspect of the game.
How It Works:
Users enter the number of overs, team names, and player names.
The game proceeds in two innings, where teams alternate between batting and bowling.
The simulator calculates scores, updates the game state after every ball, and manages overs and player rotations.
At the end of the match, a detailed scorecard and result are displayed.
This project highlights the use of structs, control statements, and user input handling to create a fun and engaging simulation of cricket. Itâ€™s an excellent demonstration of applying C programming to solve practical problems.
